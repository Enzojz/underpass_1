Hi Enzojz, this fork: 
- allows adding underpasses and stations even after a station has been finalised.
I have made the calculations more flexible to allow this, but the whole logic is a bit simpler because there is no more state.built.
- only shows the popup for not finalised objects.

I am not going to publish this independently but I am going to use it privately. Do with it whatever you want. The latest version is at https://github.com/lolluslollus/1924671230_underpass_1 .
Cheers!
